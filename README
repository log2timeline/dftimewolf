## Timeflow

A framework for orchestrating forensic collection, processing and data export.

### Configuration

Timeflow has a minimal configuration file. Timeflow looks in the current
directory, your home directory, or a directory pointed to by the
`TIMEFLOW_CONFIG` environment variable and tries to load a JSON object from
either `timeflow.json` or `.timeflowrc`.

See `/timeflow/timeflow.json` for an example configuration file.
