A framework for orchestrating forensic collection, processing and data export.

### Configuration

DFTimewolf has a minimal configuration file. DFTimewolf looks for a
`config.json` file in its directory and loads parameters from there.

See `/dftimewolf/config.json` for an example configuration file and
edit as you see fit.
